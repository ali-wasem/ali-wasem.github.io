## Techniques Behind the App

### SVG Image Handling

- **Reading SVG Images:** The app reads SVG images, which are used to represent the provinces of Iraq.
- **Parsing as XML Documents:** The SVG images are parsed as XML documents to extract necessary attributes, such as the path string that outlines each province.
- **Drawing Provinces and Borders:** The provinces are drawn using `ClipPath`, while the borders are drawn with `CustomPaint` to ensure precision and clarity.

### Animation Techniques

- **Animating Page Transitions:** Smooth transitions between pages make the app feel more dynamic and engaging.
- **Hero Widgets:** These are used to create shared element transitions between different screens, adding a layer of depth to the navigation experience.
- **OnHoverEffects:** Hovering over elements triggers subtle animations, providing visual feedback and enhancing the user experience.

### State Management

- **Using GetX:** The app utilizes GetX for efficient state management, ensuring that the UI reflects real-time changes as users interact with the app. GetX provides a lightweight and fast solution for managing complex state changes, making it ideal for this interactive application.

### Localization Support

- **Bilingual Interface:** The app supports both Arabic and English, allowing users to switch between languages seamlessly. The app automatically adjusts the layout and text direction based on the selected language, ensuring a consistent and intuitive experience.

### Adaptiveness for Different Landscape Sizes

- **Responsive Design:** The app is built with a responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes and resolutions.
